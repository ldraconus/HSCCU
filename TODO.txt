GIT workflow

Add changes to git:                         <-- repeat until feature is working

$ git add <changed files to update>

$ git commit -am "Your message"
$ git push

NOw that it's working merge your changes to dev without a fast-forward

$ git checkout main
$ git merge --no-ff working

Now push the changes to the server

$ git push

And get back to working

$ git checkout working

And you'll see it how you want it.
